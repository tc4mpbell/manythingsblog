# what would my time / productivity look like if i only did real things on the computer?

rethinking digital life

*In which Taylor realizes he's not great at doing important things first.*

I'm not very purposeful about my computer time. I'm working on ProjectPoll on nights and weekends, so I typically have ~2 hours after my kids are in bed, a full day on Friday (I work 4 day weeks), and inconsistent half-days on Saturday/Sunday.

I usually check my email when I first sit down. I have a few gmail accounts, so usually the first one that comes up with "gm"+Enter is my really old personal account, with all the deal newsletters and shipping notifications and library notices... I scroll through the New messages, click on one or two that catch my eye ("ooh, they're making a Wheel of Time show..."). 

After reading that WoT article, I flip over to my other gmail account, that I try to keep to only business/dev-related things. I'm getting some newsletter spam these days. Lots of content marketing going on. Maybe I should just unsubscribe to a bunch of these now. Oh, I sometimes find interesting articles in these [React/Startups/Developer/Founder/Indie] Weekly curated newsletters -- I'll read those first. 

My ProjectPoll email account is pretty empty, once I get there. Mostly other startups doing email outreach to pitch their products ;). No offense taken, of course. It's a reasonable lead. I'm not looking to buy any products right now, though.

All right, email done, as long as I manage to avoid clicking into the day-job mailbox, "just in case."

Quick check of HN and Twitter to see if anything cool's blowing up, and I'll be ready to go!

All right, time to start work. First stop, Analytics! What if a bunch of people visited my site last night? I should definitely know that!



What if I did none of that? 

If I never checked Twitter or HN again, my business wouldn't suffer. If I only checked email on my phone, I'd miss nothing important. I don't need to check Analytics: I want a business that supports my family, I'm objectively not close to that, and obsessing over my minute traffice stats is worthless.

What if the only programs open on my computer were a terminal, a text editor, and a browser window open to localhost:3000? 

I could: write and publish blog posts. Build features on my app.

[[dunno if its only open these, vs only do work things? but mktg is a bbbbbbb]]
