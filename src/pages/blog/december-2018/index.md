In December, I redesigned the dashboard views, tweaked the overall design for much of the internal app, and continued work on our Jira integration.

This month, I'm shifting priorities from integration work to add User Roles. This will let you tag each respondent with a role, so you can drill further into the data to see how different groups responded (PMs, front-end developers, clients, etc.).

I also started this blog! It uses [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org) under the hood, and is compiled and pushed to S3 like the rest of the marketing site.
