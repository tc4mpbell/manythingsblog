Hey it's 2019! âœ¨

What better time than the New Year to wish for things to be the way they once were... ðŸ”®

Specifically, micro-ISVs. What's with this Maker stuff, am I right? I want to go back to like, Business of Software forum days. I want Patrick to be _killing_ it again, making like 5k on Bingo Card Creator. That was awesome! 

What would we give up? Twitter? Hacker News? Meh, I see no problems. ðŸ™ˆ

Stack Overflow? Okay, I see _some_ problems. ðŸ¤”
