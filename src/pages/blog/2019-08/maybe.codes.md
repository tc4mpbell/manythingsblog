At my day job, we get a lot of junior/bootcamp applicants, especially for Javascript/React positions. Some of them are awesome, some are still learning but clearly have potential, but some can't code at all.

We started sending out some very simple coding challenges for people to do when they apply, just to give us a first gut-check on whether we should have a conversation. They're _super simple_, like `write a for loop` kinda simple. 

They send us back their answers in an email, so a dev still has to run them, change the inputs for testing, etc. So I thought, "since these are trivial, and effectively pass/fail, couldn't this be automated?" 

Obviously, the first step is to find a domain name, and thus: [maybe.codes](https://maybe.codes) was born.

Well, kinda born. It's just a landing page. I'm not _sure_ it'll ever be real -- there's a lot of very slick code exercise/interview sites out there. They all do a lot _more_ than this, and aren't cheap, but I haven't done the work to know if there's a niche here.

Either way, 'twas fun to make the landing page, and I like the domain a lot.

Do you send first-step exercises to candidates? Is it annoying? [Send me an email](mailto:taylor@manythingsblue.com) or [sign up](https://maybe.codes) to be notified if it moves forward!
